  ## Description
  This project provides the backend functionality for a full-stack application, Just Tech News â€” a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Configured using Sequelize, bycrypt password hashing, and JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.
  
  Because a front-end has not been developed, posts can be created and fetched by using Insomnia.
